# sales-analysis-project
sales data analysis using python,pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of sales data using Pandas,Matplotlib, and Seaborn, all inside Google Colab.
It analyzes monthly sales trends and identifies top-performing product categories using a dataset similar to the Global Superstore dataset.

# Tools & Libraries
- Python 3 (Google Colab environment)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

## 📁 Folder Structure
sales-analysis/
├── data/
│   └── superstore.csv
├── sales_analysis.ipynb
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt

##  Key Features

- Cleans and preprocesses the dataset
- Converts order dates to datetime format
- Extracts and groups data by year and month
- Visualizes:
- Monthly sales trends
- Top 5 product categories by revenues.

## Dataset Used

We use a cleaned-up version of the Global Superstore dataset. Columns include:
- `Order Date`
- `Sales`
- `Category`
- `Profit` *(optional)*
- `Sub-Category`, `Region`, `Segment`, etc.
 This dataset is uploaded manually to Colab during runtime.

##  How to Run This Project

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Upload the `superstore.csv` file manually (via the sidebar)
3. Run all cells to see analysis and charts

##  Sample Visualizations

- Monthly Sales by Year  
- Top Product Categories by Revenue  

These visualizations help identify peak sales periods and high-performing product lines.

##  Future Improvements

- Add profit trend analysis
- Segment-wise or region-wise breakdown
- Dashboard with interactive plots (e.g., Plotly)
